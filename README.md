Currently a mess.

Ignore everything named `EGKK` etc, it has nothing (specifically) to do with Gatwick.

Use at your own risk, currently not well tested so I wouldn't recommend using on the live network.

## Supported commands:
- `.handoff` - Handoff


## (Somewhat) planned features:
- Private scratchpad
- Vatsim pilot / controller rating display for each pilot
- (maybe) an easy way to briefly fill out controller feedback (more feedback = better right?)

If you have any more ideas feel free to DM me :smile:
